# Ensemble-Learning-Voting-Algorithm-
This GitHub code snippet performs data analysis and machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
# Titanic Survival Prediction


## What Can This Code Do?

1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
    I start by reading the dataset from a CSV file.
    To get a feel for the data, I visualize missing information with colorful heatmaps.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   Next, I dive into exploratory analysis, painting a picture of the Titanic's passengers with count plots and distribution plots.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   Every adventure has its challenges, and in this case, it's dealing with missing values.
   I also get our hands dirty with some one-hot encoding to get our data in shape.

4. Feature Selection:
   Choosing the right features is like assembling your crew. I use Lasso regression to select the most crucial ones.

5. Model Training:
   I combine forces from three different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors using our trusty Voting Classifier.

6. Prediction:**
   After all the hard work, it's time to make predictions for a test dataset. I write our findings to a CSV file for your perusal.

Getting Started

How to Use
